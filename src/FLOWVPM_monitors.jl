# DESCRIPTION
    Run time functions to monitor flow metrics. These functions ought to be
    passed to `run_vpm!(...)` through the `runtime_function` optional argument.

"""
Runtime function that calculates the enstrophy of the particle field, or global
enstrophy of the flow. This is calculated by integrating the local enstrophy
defined as ξ = ω⋅ω / 2

Enstrophy is approximated as 0.5*Σ( ζσ(0) Γ𝑝⋅Γ𝑝 ). This is inaccurate, but is a
quick, dirty, and cheap way of getting an idea of how the enstrophy of the
system may be evolving (see notebook 20210702).

Enstrophy is approximated as 0.5*Σ( Γ𝑝⋅ω(x𝑝) ). This is consistent with
Winckelamns' 1995 CTR report ("Some Progress in LES using the 3-D VPM").
See notebook 20210702.

NOTE: This function assumes that the vorticity field has already been
precalculated, which is true if this function is called after the relaxation
step. DON'T USE THIS MONITOR UNLESS YOU KNOW THAT THIS CONDITION IS MET.
